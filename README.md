## Overview

**GlowRoot Planter™** is a **self-sustaining indoor garden system** that uses **bioluminescent organisms, mycelium, and biochar** to create a **low-maintenance, air-purifying, and food-growing solution** for apartments and homes.  

It provides **gentle, natural light at night**, reduces water and fertilizer needs through **nutrient recycling**, and actively improves indoor air quality while producing fresh herbs, vegetables, or decorative plants.

---

## Core Features

- **Bioluminescent Lighting** – Naturally illuminates plants at night without external power.  
- **Closed-Loop Nutrient Cycle** – Biochar and mycelium recycle nutrients, **cutting water use by 70%**.  
- **Air Purification** – Plants and fungi absorb VOCs, CO₂, and particulates while releasing oxygen.  
- **Modular & Stylish Design** – Available as countertop or floor-standing units.  
- **Low Maintenance** – Requires only **monthly topping-up of water and nutrients**.

---

## How It Works

1. **Bioluminescent Microflora** – Engineered, safe organisms glow softly, supporting plant growth cycles and ambiance.  
2. **Mycelium-Biochar Substrate** – Retains water, captures nutrients, and sustains a thriving micro-ecosystem.  
3. **Capillary Watering System** – Distributes moisture evenly, preventing over- or under-watering.  
4. **Plant & Air Synergy** – Plants grow steadily while the system filters and freshens indoor air.
